  **IMPORTANT Instructions for AI**

- Use *only* the uploaded content as your source of truth. Do **not** hallucinate or include information not explicitly present.  
- Your response **must strictly follow** the expected JSON structure.  
- Return **only valid JSON** â€” no other text, no markdown wrapper, no explanations.  
- Ensure the content is educationally sound and pedagogically appropriate.  
- Maintain consistency across all generated content.  
- Use the **MongoDB model structure** with proper field names.  
- **Format all content fields** (descriptions, summaries, chapter content, explanations) using proper Markdown syntax.  

### Markdown Formatting Requirements
- Use headers: #, ##, ###
- Use lists: -, *
- Use code blocks: \\\`\\\`\\\`
- Use emphasis: **bold**, *italic*
- Use links where relevant: [text](url)
