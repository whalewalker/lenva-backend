  **IMPORTANT Instructions for AI**

- Use *only* the uploaded content as your source of truth. Do **not** hallucinate or include information not explicitly present.  
- Your response **must strictly follow** the expected JSON structure.  
- Return **only valid JSON** â€” no other text, no markdown wrapper, no explanations.  
- Ensure the content is educationally sound and pedagogically appropriate.  
- Maintain consistency across all generated content.  
- Use the **MongoDB model structure** with proper field names.  
- **Format all content fields** (descriptions, summaries, chapter content, explanations) using proper Markdown syntax.  

### Markdown Formatting Requirements
- Use headers: #, ##, ###
- Use lists: -, *
- Use code blocks: \\\`\\\`\\\`
- Use emphasis: **bold**, *italic*
- Use links where relevant: [text](url)

---

Your final output must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly.`;

You must not introduce any new information that is not reasonably inferred from the input. The depth and length of the generated content, including the number of chapters and detail in summaries, should be appropriate to the richness and volume of the provided resource material.

The output must include:
- A clear and relevant **course title**.
- A detailed comprehensive **course summary string**. This string must contain, in the following strict order:
    1. A narrative **course overview** describing the core subject matter, main themes, and topics covered.
    2. A bulleted list of **core concepts** that form the foundation of the course material.
    3. A bulleted list of **technical terms** representing the key technologies, tools, and methodologies covered.
    4. A detailed **chapter-by-chapter breakdown** that begins with the phrase:  
       "The course content is organized into these chapters:"  
       Each chapter should include:
         - A clear chapter title.
         - A concise description of the chapter's subject matter and content areas.
         - Bullet points outlining the main topics and concepts covered.

- A **list of suggested chapters** (separate from the summary string) for organizing course content, with each chapter containing:
   - title: the chapter title
   - quizQuestionCount: number of quiz questions to be generated for this chapter (scale proportionally to chapter size and complexity)
   - flashcardCount: number of flashcards to be generated for this chapter (scale proportionally to chapter size and concept density)
   - acronymCount: number of acronyms to be generated for this chapter (based on actual technical terms present)
   - simulationQuestionCount: number of simulation questions to be generated for this chapter (scale according to practical applications in the chapter)
- A **metadata** object (separate from the summary string) including:
    - Overall course duration 
    - Subject category
    - Difficulty level: {{difficulty}}

Instructions:
1. **Content Structure**: Analyze the provided educational material and extract main topics and subject areas.
2. **Summary String Format**: Include course description, core concepts, technical terms, and chapter structure.
3. **Chapter Organization**: List all chapter titles in sequential order.
4. **Metadata**: Include difficulty level, course duration, and subject category.

   - Intermediate: Applications and relationships between concepts
   - Advanced: Edge cases, nuances, and complex implementations
3. Include practical examples and real-world applications for each concept
4. Focus on conceptual understanding and connections to other topics
5. Each flashcard must have:
   - Front: Concise question, term, or prompt
   - Back: Clear, direct answer
   - Explanation: Detailed elaboration with examples and context
6. Distribute flashcards across different concept categories in the chapter
7. Prioritize the most important concepts based on their relevance to the overall topic

If fewer than {{count}} key concepts exist in the chapter content, focus on quality over quantity. Create multiple flashcards for complex concepts rather than inventing content.
